### Submission for Line of Code Hackathon
Chosen Problem Statement: Virtual Library Administrator

### Introduction
Our project aims to develop a decentralized platform which facilitates a P2P marketplace for e-books while incentivizing the readers to read more, while at the same time empowering small authors with a place to promote their books and earn at the same time. 

### Some Problems in the current virtual library scenario
- Small and medium level authors don't earn a lot from centralized platforms like Kindle because their books are really hard to be found. 
- Current platforms don't have any incentivazation mechanism to promote reading books.
- Even if people start reading, it becomes very hard to stay consistent and read everyday. 
- Centralized platforms have full control over your data, and can manipulate vital information that determine your earnings. 

### Our Solution
- Our solution is a decentralized virtual library that enables anyone to list their books and incentives the readers to read by allowing them to earn cryptocurrency once they complete reading a book. 
- Further, our platform will also reward the prominent readers on our platform (i.e top 10 readers etc.) with unique NFTs once they achieve goals and targets.
- Our platform pays the creators (i.e the authors) by rewarding them based on the number of downloads of their book on our platform, and further incentivizes them by allowing them to earn bonuses based on number of people who actually complete their book. 
- Our platform aims to create a habit among people for reading by creating a virtual community and cohort based reading which enables people to read with their friends, and meet new people who have similar interests. 

### DeFi Aspect
Each author who wants to list their book on our platform, will have to pay a one-time deposit in cryptocurrency, which is refunded to them whenever they want to leave our platform. The author is allowed to lend how much ever he wants above a base limit. (However, the more he lends, the more he is able to incentivize his readers). This deposit is locked up in a DeFi protocol such as Aave which enables us to generate interest from the cryptocurrency. This generated interest is used to incentivize the readers. 

#### But how about verifying someone actually read the book?
This is done by an easy quiz, probably around 10 questions, and once the reader completes the quiz, he can claim his incentive amount. The incentive amount for the reader is deteremined on the basis of the number of people in his cohort who successfully complete reading the book and complete the quiz, and the amount that is lent by the author of the book. (Higher the lending, the better)

Our platform could even enable a revenue sharing model where the author could also make money from the interest earned, apart from what the platform pays the author. 

### How does our platform make money?
Our platform will offer subscription servies to the customers that enable them to
